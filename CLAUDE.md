- Always, please let me know if you have any questions prior to proceeding. Also feel free to interrupt your work to ask me questions when they come up.
- Create unit tests and test the code you write.
- Don't read or modify files in ./PLANNING/
- The desired specification is in SPECIFICATION.md. If told to implement the updated specification, first use `git log --oneline SPECIFICATION.md` to find when the file was last modified, then use `git diff <commit-hash> SPECIFICATION.md` to see what new functionality to implement or change compared to the last time the specification was actually updated. (Ignore minor formatting changes in SPECIFICATION.md file itself.)
- When git committing, also include SPECIFICATION.md
