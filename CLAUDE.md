- Always, please let me know if you have any questions prior to proceeding. Also feel free to interrupt your work to ask me questions when they come up.
- Create unit tests and test the code you write.
- Don't read or modify files in ./PLANNING/
- The desired specification is in SPECIFICATION.md. Please read it when you need to get a big picture perspective on the project. 
- If told to _implement the updated specification_, use `git diff SPECIFICATION.md` to see uncommitted changes and implement only those changes. (Ignore minor formatting changes in SPECIFICATION.md file itself.)
- When git committing, also include SPECIFICATION.md
