# Irreducible Canonical Reactions from IBOT Algorithm
# Total reactions: 0
# Total iterations: 0
#
# Notation:
#   - Polymers are shown in brackets: {monomer1; monomer2; ...}
#   - Monomer multiplicities shown as prefix: {2 monomer1; monomer2}
#   - Polymers marked with ^ were assigned Î¼ in that iteration
