# TBN Explorer 2

A Python library and command-line tools for analyzing Thermodynamics of Binding Networks (TBN) models.

## Overview

The TBN (Thermodynamics of Binding Networks) model is a framework for studying abstract chemical systems at equilibrium. In this model:

- **Binding sites** (domains) are the fundamental units that can bind to complementary partners
- **Monomers** are collections (multisets) of binding sites  
- **Polymers** (complexes) are collections of monomers that bind together through complementary binding sites

The system must be star limiting and enthalpy is assumed to be infinite.

Given a set of monomers (described by their binding sites) and their initial concentrations, TBN Explorer computes:
1. The **polymer basis** - the set of fundamental "unsplittable" polymers
2. The **free energies** of each polymer equal to the number of bonds
3. The **equilibrium concentrations** of all polymers in the system

## Command-Line Tools

### tbnexplorer2 - Main Analysis Tool

Computes polymer bases, free energies, and equilibrium concentrations.

```bash
tbnexplorer2 input.tbn [options]

Options:
  -h, --help                        Show help message
  --normaliz-path PATH              Path to Normaliz executable
  --user-friendly-polymer-basis     Generate human-readable polymer basis file
  --no-concentrations               Skip concentration calculations
  --no-free-energies                Skip free energy calculations (also skips concentrations)
  -v, --verbose                     Enable verbose output
```

**Outputs:**
- `input.tbnpolymat` - Matrix file with polymer compositions, free energies, and concentrations
- `input-polymer-basis.txt` - Human-readable polymer basis (with `--user-friendly-polymer-basis`)

### tbnexplorer2-filter - Polymer Filtering Tool

Filters and displays polymers containing specific monomers.

```bash
tbnexplorer2-filter input.tbn [monomer1] [monomer2] ... [options]

Options:
  -n, --num N                Maximum number of polymers to output (default: 100)
  -p, --percent-limit P      Only show polymers above P% of total concentration
  --constraints-file FILE    Advanced filtering with constraint specifications
```

**Constraint File Format:**
```
CONTAINS monomer1 monomer2    # Polymers containing these monomers
EXACTLY monomer1 monomer2     # Polymers with exactly these monomers
```

## TBN File Format (.tbn)

TBN files describe monomers as collections of binding sites with optional concentrations.

### Basic Syntax

```
# Comments start with #
\UNITS: nM                         # Concentration units (nM, pM, uM, mM, M)

monomer_name: site1 site2 site3, 100   # Named monomer with concentration
site1 site2* >another_name, 50         # Alternative naming syntax
site1 site2 site3                      # Unnamed monomer (no concentration without UNITS)
```

### Binding Sites

- **Unstar sites**: Regular binding sites (e.g., `a`, `b1`, `xyz`)
- **Star sites**: Complementary sites ending with `*` (e.g., `a*`, `b1*`)
- Complementary pairs (`a` and `a*`) can bind together
- Prohibited characters in names: `,`, `>`, `*`, `|`, `:`, `\`

### Key Rules

1. **Units Consistency**: With `\UNITS` keyword, ALL monomers must have concentrations. Without it, NO monomers can have concentrations.
2. **Star-limiting Restriction**: For each binding site type, total unstar count ≥ total star count across all monomers
3. **Duplicate Monomers**: 
   - Without UNITS: Treated independently
   - With UNITS: Concentrations are summed (must have same name or one named)

### Example TBN Files

**Simple system without concentrations:**
```
# Simple binding network
A: a b c
B: a* b* c*
dimer: d d e
complement: d* d* e*
```

**System with concentrations:**
```
\UNITS: nM
initiator: a b, 100
propagator: a* b c, 50
terminator: c* d, 75
cap: d*, 25.5
```

## Output Formats

### .tbnpolymat File

Matrix format with polymers sorted by concentration:
```
# Header with metadata
\MATRIX-HASH: [hash]
\UNITS: nM
# Columns: [monomer multiplicities] [free energy] [concentration]
1 0 2 0 -3 45.2
0 1 1 1 -2 12.8
...
```

### User-Friendly Polymer Basis

Human-readable format showing polymer composition:
```
# Polymer 1
2 | monomer_name
1 | a b c

# Polymer 2
1 | initiator
3 | propagator
```

## Python API

Use TBN Explorer as a Python library:

```python
from tbnexplorer2 import TBNParser, TBN, PolymerBasisComputer, FreeEnergyCalculator

# Parse TBN file
monomers, binding_sites = TBNParser.parse_file("input.tbn")

# Create TBN model
tbn = TBN(monomers, binding_sites)

# Check star-limiting restriction
is_valid, error_msg = tbn.check_star_limiting()
if not is_valid:
    print(f"Error: {error_msg}")
    exit(1)

# Compute polymer basis
computer = PolymerBasisComputer(tbn)
polymer_basis = computer.compute_polymer_basis()

# Calculate free energies
calc = FreeEnergyCalculator(tbn)
free_energies = calc.compute_free_energies(polymer_basis)

# Compute equilibrium concentrations (requires COFFEE)
if tbn.has_concentrations:
    concentrations = computer.compute_equilibrium_concentrations(
        polymer_basis, free_energies, tbn.monomer_concentrations
    )
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching

The polymer basis computation (most expensive operation) is cached based on the monomer matrix hash. When re-running with different concentrations but same monomers, the cached basis is reused automatically.

### Large Systems

TBN Explorer is designed to handle:
- Polymer bases with hundreds of thousands of polymers
- Efficient matrix operations using NumPy
- Streaming I/O for large output files

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_parser.py::TestTBNParser::test_units_parsing

# Check code quality
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Normaliz not found" Error

1. Install Normaliz from https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz
2. Either:
   - Use `--normaliz-path` to specify location
   - Edit `NORMALIZ_PATH` in `tbnexplorer2/normaliz.py`

### "COFFEE not found" Error

1. Build COFFEE from source (see COFFEE documentation)
2. Update path in `tbnexplorer2/coffee.py`

### Star-limiting Restriction Errors

- Ensure for each binding site: unstar count ≥ star count
- Use `--verbose` to identify problematic sites
- Check concentration values if using UNITS

### Missing Concentrations

- With `\UNITS`: ALL monomers need concentrations
- Without `\UNITS`: NO monomers should have concentrations
- Use `--no-concentrations` to skip equilibrium calculations
