# TBN Explorer 2

A Python library and command-line tools for analyzing Thermodynamics of Binding Networks (TBN) models.

## Overview

The TBN (Thermodynamics of Binding Networks) model is a framework for studying abstract chemical systems at equilibrium. In this model:

- **Binding sites** (domains) are the fundamental units that can bind to complementary partners
- **Monomers** are collections (multisets) of binding sites  
- **Polymers** (complexes) are collections of monomers that bind together through complementary binding sites

Enthalpy is assumed to be infinitely preferred over entropy and the system must be "star-binding site limiting". Please see [1,2] for details of the TBN model.

Given a set of monomers (described by their binding sites) and their initial concentrations, TBN Explorer computes:
1. The **polymer basis** - the set of "unsplittable" polymers [3]
2. The **free energies** of each polymer equal to the number of bonds
3. The **equilibrium concentrations** of all polymers in the system [4]

### Extensions

TBN Explorer also includes an extension for implementing the algorithm from [5] for computing off-target polymer concentration using iterative detailed balancing, here called the **IBOT Algorithm** (Iterative Balancing of Off-Target Polymers).

  -v, --verbose                     Enable verbose output
```

**Purpose:**
- Identifies irreducible canonical reactions between on-target and off-target polymers
- Assigns concentration exponents to off-target polymers maintaining detailed balance
- Generates concentration specifications for all polymers

**Inputs:**
- `input.tbn`: TBN file without concentrations (no \UNITS)
- `on_target.tbnpolys`: File specifying which polymers are considered "on-target"

**Outputs:**
- `input-ibot-output.tbnpolys`: All polymers with concentration exponents (μ values)
- `input-ibot-cX.tbn`: Generated TBN file with concentrations (if --generate-tbn used)

## TBN File Format (.tbn)

TBN files describe monomers as collections of binding sites with optional concentrations.

### Basic Syntax

```
# Comments start with #
\UNITS: nM                         # Concentration units (nM, pM, uM, mM, M)

monomer_name: site1 site2 site3, 100   # Named monomer with concentration
site1 site2* >another_name, 50         # Alternative naming syntax
site1 site2 site3                      # Unnamed monomer (no concentration without UNITS)
```

### Binding Sites

- **Unstar sites**: Regular binding sites (e.g., `a`, `b1`, `xyz`)
- **Star sites**: Complementary sites ending with `*` (e.g., `a*`, `b1*`)
- Complementary pairs (`a` and `a*`) can bind together
- Prohibited characters in names: `,`, `>`, `*`, `|`, `:`, `\`

### Key Rules

1. **Units Consistency**: With `\UNITS` keyword, ALL monomers must have concentrations. Without it, NO monomers can have concentrations.
2. **Star-limiting Restriction**: For each binding site type, total unstar count ≥ total star count across all monomers
3. **Duplicate Monomers**: 
   - Without UNITS: Treated independently
   - With UNITS: Concentrations are summed (must have same name or one named)

### Example TBN Files

**Simple system without concentrations:**
```
# Simple binding network
A: a b c
B: a* b* c*
dimer: d d e
complement: d* d* e*
```

**System with concentrations:**
```
\UNITS: nM
initiator: a b, 100
propagator: a* b c, 50
terminator: c* d, 75
cap: d*, 25.5
```

### Parametrized TBN Files

TBN files support template variables and arithmetic expressions for flexible concentration specifications:

```
\UNITS: nM
# Simple variable substitution
monomer1: a b, {{conc1}}

# Arithmetic expressions
scaled: c d, {{base_conc * scale_factor}}
average: e f, {{(conc1 + conc2) / 2}}
complex: g h, {{conc1 * 0.7 + conc2 * 0.3}}

# Mix templates with literal values
fixed: i j, 100
```

**Running with parameters:**
```bash
tbnexplorer2 input.tbn --parametrized conc1=50 conc2=100 base_conc=75 scale_factor=2
```

**Supported operations in templates:**
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Exponentiation: `**` (e.g., `{{2 ** 3}}` evaluates to 8)
- Parentheses for grouping: `{{(a + b) * c}}`
- Floating point: `{{x * 1.5 + y * 0.5}}`

## Output Formats

### .tbnpolymat File

Matrix format with polymers sorted by concentration:
```
# Header with metadata
\MATRIX-HASH: [hash]
\UNITS: nM
# Columns: [monomer multiplicities] [free energy] [concentration]
1 0 2 0 -3 45.2
0 1 1 1 -2 12.8
...
```

### User-Friendly Polymer Basis

Human-readable format showing polymer composition:
```
# Polymer 1
2 | monomer_name
1 | a b c

# Polymer 2
initiator
3 | propagator
```
Note: when the multiplicity prefix "{n} |" is missing, the multiplicity is assumed to be 1.

## Extensions

### Canonical Reactions Analysis

The canonical reactions module identifies and analyzes irreducible reactions that generate off-target polymers from on-target ones.

**Key Concepts:**
- **On-target polymers**: Desired polymer configurations specified in a .tbnpolys file
- **Off-target polymers**: All other polymers in the polymer basis
- **Canonical reactions**: Reactions that create off-target polymers from purely on-target reactants
- **Irreducible canonical reactions**: Fundamental reactions that cannot be decomposed into simpler ones

### IBOT Algorithm (Iterative Balancing of Off-Target Polymers)

The IBOT algorithm assigns concentration exponents to polymers to maintain detailed balance in the system. The algorithm is developed in [5].

**Algorithm Overview:**
1. All on-target polymers are assigned concentration exponent μ = 1
2. Iteratively assigns concentration exponents to off-target polymers based on:
   - **Novelty**: Number of unassigned off-target polymers in a reaction
   - **Imbalance**: Difference in concentration exponents between reactants and products
   - **Imbalance-novelty ratio**: Used to determine assignment priority
3. Polymers unreachable from on-target reactions are excluded

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Compute polymer basis from TBN without concentrations
tbnexplorer2 system.tbn --user-friendly-polymer-basis

# 2. Create on_target.tbnpolys file specifying desired polymers
# (manually or programmatically select from polymer basis)

# 3. Run IBOT analysis
tbnexplorer2-ibot system.tbn on_target.tbnpolys --verbose

# 4. Generate TBN with computed concentrations
tbnexplorer2-ibot system.tbn on_target.tbnpolys --generate-tbn 0.01 nM

# 5. Verify equilibrium with generated concentrations
tbnexplorer2 system-ibot-c0.01.tbn

# 6. Filter and view results
tbnexplorer2-filter system-ibot-c0.01.tbn -n 50
```

### .tbnpolys File Format

Polymer specification files for defining on-target polymers and viewing results.

**Format:**
```
# Comment describing polymer
2 | monomer_name     # 2 copies of named monomer
1 | a b c            # 1 copy of monomer with sites a, b, c
                     # Empty line separates polymers
# Next polymer
1 | monomer2
3 | d e f

# Concentration exponents (in IBOT output)
# μ: 1.5
```

**Key Rules:**
- Empty lines (not comments) separate different polymers
- Multiplicity prefix `n |` indicates n copies of the monomer
- Monomers can be specified by name or binding site list
- μ values appear in IBOT output files

## Python API

Use TBN Explorer as a Python library:

```python
from tbnexplorer2 import TBNParser, TBN, PolymerBasisComputer, FreeEnergyCalculator

# Parse TBN file
monomers, binding_sites = TBNParser.parse_file("input.tbn")

# Parse TBN file with parametrized variables
variables = {"conc1": 50, "conc2": 100, "scale": 1.5}
monomers, binding_sites, units, used_vars = TBNParser.parse_file("parametrized.tbn", variables)

# Create TBN model
tbn = TBN(monomers, binding_sites)

# Check star-limiting restriction
is_valid, error_msg = tbn.check_star_limiting()
if not is_valid:
    print(f"Error: {error_msg}")
    exit(1)

# Compute polymer basis
computer = PolymerBasisComputer(tbn)
polymer_basis = computer.compute_polymer_basis()

# Calculate free energies
calc = FreeEnergyCalculator(tbn)
free_energies = calc.compute_free_energies(polymer_basis)

# Compute equilibrium concentrations (requires COFFEE)
if tbn.has_concentrations:
    concentrations = computer.compute_equilibrium_concentrations(
        polymer_basis, free_energies, tbn.monomer_concentrations
    )
```

### Extensions API

```python
from extensions import CanonicalReactionsComputer, IBOTAlgorithm
from tbnexplorer2 import TBNPolysParser

# Load on-target polymers
on_target_polymers = TBNPolysParser.parse_file("on_target.tbnpolys", tbn)

# Compute irreducible canonical reactions
reactions_computer = CanonicalReactionsComputer(tbn, polymer_basis)
irreducible_reactions = reactions_computer.compute_irreducible_canonical_reactions(
    on_target_polymers
)

# Run IBOT algorithm
ibot = IBOTAlgorithm(tbn, polymer_basis, irreducible_reactions)
concentration_exponents = ibot.compute_concentration_exponents(on_target_polymers)

# Generate monomer concentrations
monomer_concentrations = ibot.generate_monomer_concentrations(
    concentration_exponents, 
    base_concentration=0.01,  # in Molar
    units="nM"
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching

The polymer basis computation (most expensive operation) is cached based on the monomer matrix hash. When re-running with different concentrations but same monomers, the cached basis is reused automatically.

### Large Systems

TBN Explorer is designed to handle:
- Polymer bases with hundreds of thousands of polymers
- Efficient matrix operations using NumPy
- Streaming I/O for large output files

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_parser.py::TestTBNParser::test_units_parsing

# Test IBOT pipeline end-to-end
python extensions/test_ibot_pipeline.py

# Check code quality
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

### Testing the IBOT Pipeline

The `test_ibot_pipeline.py` script validates the complete IBOT workflow:
1. Generates concentration exponents using IBOT algorithm
2. Creates a TBN file with computed concentrations
3. Runs equilibrium calculation with tbnexplorer2
4. Verifies that equilibrium concentrations match expected values

This ensures the mathematical consistency of the concentration exponent assignments.

## Troubleshooting

### "Normaliz not found" Error

1. Install Normaliz from https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz
2. Either:
   - Set `NORMALIZ_PATH` in your `.env` file
   - Use `--normaliz-path` to specify location
   - Export `NORMALIZ_PATH` environment variable

### "COFFEE not found" Error

1. Build COFFEE from source (see COFFEE documentation)
2. Set `COFFEE_CLI_PATH` in your `.env` file or environment

### Star-limiting Restriction Errors

- Ensure for each binding site: unstar count ≥ star count
- Use `--verbose` to identify problematic sites
- Check concentration values if using UNITS

### Missing Concentrations

- With `\UNITS`: ALL monomers need concentrations
- Without `\UNITS`: NO monomers should have concentrations
- Use `--no-concentrations` to skip equilibrium calculations
