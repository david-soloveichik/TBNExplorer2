Our code will have multiple conceptual parts:

(1) Given a TBN, compute the set of "unsplittable" polymers H. This is defined in terms of a Hilbert basis of a specific linear problem.

(2) Compute the free energies of each polymer in H. For simplicity, this will just be the negation of the total number of bonds that can form in the polymer.

(3) Compute concentrations of all the polymers in H

# Caching polymer basis
The most computationally intensive part of the pipeline is computing the polymer basis with Normaliz. Using COFFEE is very fast.
Thus if we want to recompute polymer concentrations for new input monomer concentrations without changing what the monomers are, we should avoid re-computing the polymer basis.
